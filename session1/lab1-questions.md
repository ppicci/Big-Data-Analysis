### BDA Seminar 1 - Part 1 & 2

**Complete the following exercises on computational complexity.**

1. Study the following script. This program implements a `linear_search(arr, x)` function that returns element `x`'s index in the list `arr`. If `x` is not found, it returns `-1`.

```python
def linear_search(arr, x):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == x:
            return i
    return -1
```

2. Now, let's put your understanding to the test. Can you determine the time complexity of the following script? Take a moment to think about it.

```Py
if __name__ == "__main__":
  data = [10,20,30,40,50,50,60,80,90,100]
  result = linear_search(data,40)
  print(result)
```

### BDA Seminar 1 - Part 2

**Complete the following exercises on creating small programs.**

1. Examine the following code. The script calculates the time needed to run the `all_permutations` function.

```python
import time
from itertools import permutations

def all_permutations(elements):
    return list(permutations(elements))

if __name__ == "__main__":
  elements=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]  
  # Start the timer
  start = time.time()
  result = all_permutations(elements)
  # End the timer
  end = time.time()
  
  print(f'Total time to run (seconds):',round(end-start,4))
```

2. Let's begin by downloading our initial large file, the Common Password List (`rockyou.txt`). Download the file from [Common Passwords List in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wjburns/common-password-list-rockyoutxt). 
   * Download the file and save it in the same directory as your Python script.
3. Examine the following script. The script extracts each line of our file using the `strip` that removes any leading or trailing whitespace.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
  with open('rockyou.txt', 'r',encoding='ISO-8859-1') as file:
    for line in file:
      # Strip newline and whitespace from the line
      current_password = line.strip()
      print(current_password)
      break
```

> [!TIP]
>
> `ISO 8859-1` is the ISO standard Latin-1 character set and encoding format.

4. How many passwords are in the file?

```python
def count_pass(file_path):
  # Provide your Python script here
  

## Use the following main
if __name__ == "__main__":
  print(count_pass('rockyou.txt'))
```

> There are 14344391 passwords; make sure your result is correct.

> [!TIP]
>
> When working with files, use the `except FileNotFoundError` .

5. What is the computational complexity of the above script?

| Provide your answer here. |
| ------------------------- |
|                           |

6. Create a `search_password` function to search for a password in a given file.

```python

import os

def search_password(file_path, target_password):
    # Provide your solution here


if __name__ == "__main__":
    file_path = input("Enter the path to the password file: ")
    target_password = input("Enter the password to search for: ")
    found = search_password(file_path, target_password)
    if found:
        print("Password found.")
    else:
        print("Password not found.")
```

7. Calculate the time to find:

* 1234

**:mount_fuji: The following tasks are challenging.**

9. Create a script to find out if there are any duplicated records in the rockyou.txt file.

* Store your results in a list.
* For this script, you have to use a nested loop.

:clock1: Try only using the first 25 records. Otherwise, this script might run for hours!

Then, run it for the whole dataset. Is it ever finished?

```python
def check_duplicates1(file_path):
  	# Provide your solution here
    

if __name__ == "__main__":
    file_path = "rockyou.txt"
    check_duplicates1(file_path)

```

10. What is the space complexity?

| ------------------------- |
|                           |

11. Create a script to find the duplicated records in the `rockyou.tx`t file.

- Use a set instead of a list to store your data.
- Print a set of the duplicated values at the end.

```python
def check_duplicates2(file_path):
    # Provide your solution here

if __name__ == "__main__":
    file_path = "rockyou.txt"
    check_duplicates2(file_path)
```
