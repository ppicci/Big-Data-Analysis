### Big Data Analytics 2024 Project 2

##### ðŸŽ¥ Welcome to **MiniNet**

**MiniNet** offers an online TV show streaming service similar to Netflix. It allows users to subscribe to various subscription plans, watch TV shows and videos, and rate/review their watched content. The database for MiniNet needs to manage user data, subscription plans, TV shows, videos, user reviews, watch favourites, and the details of the actors involved in the shows.

Your task is to develop the entity-relationship (ER) model and analyse the relationships using your reasoning skills. Then, you must build the SQL database based on your ER model and develop queries to demonstrate your understanding.

Good luck ðŸš€

### Part 1: Project 2 Description

* Consider the following use case text.

You must design an entity-relationship model for the given use case. You will need to identify the appropriate tables and their relationships. You will also need to identify attributes per table. **Make sure you explore Task 4 queries before designing your attributes**. Feel free to improvise when identifying the fields; the more, the better.

```
At MiniNet, users subscribe to watch a wide variety of movies and TV shows. Each user can have only one subscription, choosing between two options: HD or UHD. The content is organized into categories like comedy and drama, as well as by type, such as TV shows and movies.

Users can watch an unlimited number of movies and can maintain a single list of favorite movies. Each movie in the favorite list includes a user-assigned score. Additionally, MiniNet keeps detailed records of the actors in each movie, including their names, cities of residence, and dates of birth.
```

Base your cardinality design on logical arguments while at the same time considering the following requirements:

* Each user can have only one subscription.
* There are two subscription types: HD (Â£12) and UHD (Â£18).
* For each user, in addition to your desired attributes, you need to store the `user city`, `country`, and `age`.
* Each user can only have one favourite list.
* Actors should have an age.
* Actors are associated with more than one movie.
* Each movie belongs to a category, e.g. comedy, drama, etc.
* There should be at least one movie starting with the keyword `The`, e.g., `The Lord of the Rings`.
* Each user can give only one review per video.
* Each review can be any number between 0 to 5.

ðŸš¨ You can make assumptions for the rest of the relationships.

### Part 2: Project 2 Tasks

#### Task 1 [30 marks]

Design an ER model to include the following:

a) Entities according to the use case.

b) Relationships between entities.

c) Cardinality of relationships.

d) Attributes (2-5 per entity) and their data types.

e) An ER diagram in your preferred format. The diagram can be a screenshot of your in-paper design or can be designed in your preferred software, e.g., PowerPoint.

ðŸš¨ Feel free to improvise when deciding the data types of the attributes. You can base your decision on logical arguments, such as a first name should be a character variable of up to 30 characters, etc.

#### Task 2 [10 marks]

You must provide the scripts to create the database model in SQL. Consider the following:

* Make sure that you identify the appropriate relationships using primary and foreign keys.
* Make sure you identify the appropriate constraints when linking the tables.
* You need to enforce referential integrity when creating the tables, for example, you should not be able to delete a user if there is an active subscription.

Provide the SQL scripts for creating the database and **at least five tables, including movies, users, reviews, actors, and subscriptions**. Provide your scripts in a report.

#### Task 3 [5 marks]

Provide the SQL scripts for inserting data into the database tables. You should insert at least five records per table. Explore **Part 3** on example data.

#### Task 4 [25 total marks]

Create queries for extracting data. **Feel free to adjust the queries if your database does not include these values.**

ðŸš¨ The queries could be customised according to your requirements, e.g., show an actor's first name, last name, date of birth, etc.

The following queries demonstrate example outputs for your reference. **Note that your outputs could be different, based on your database structure, and in case you insert different data.**

4.1 Export all data about users in the `HD` subscriptions.
